# Does diversity trump ability? Replication of two ABM studies

This repo contains code that replicates the model proposed by Hong & Page (2004), who suggested that diversity trumps ability, i.e. that a randomly selected group of problem solvers outperforms a group of the best problem solvers, who will be less diverse.

It also contains replication code for Grim et al. (2019), who extended the model and proposed that the original results only apply to domains where there is no expertise.

It is based on the [mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa) framework.
